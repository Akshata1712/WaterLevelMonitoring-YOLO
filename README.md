# WaterLevelMonitoring-YOLO
This project leverages YOLOv8n, to accurately identify water level markers from images captured at different timestamps. Detected regions are cropped, augmented using Albumentations, and aligned with structured water level data from Excel sheets. The resulting dataset forms the foundation for machine learning models aimed at predicting water levels
